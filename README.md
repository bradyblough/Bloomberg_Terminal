# Bloomberg_Terminal
A bloomberg terminal that alerts users if their stock price has gone up or down by a specific amount. This code is a proof of concept, and should not be used as a tool to trade, but it shows that you can get similar functionality to an expensive Bloomberg terminal realtively easily with 70-ish lines of code.

Requirements:
Pyhton 3.7 or less, as the NEWSAPI has not been updated to work with newer Python versions.
Your own Stock API key, News API key, and Twilio API key and phone number.

Suggestions:
 If you wanted to get an alert every time the price goes up or down by an amount I would reccomend automating it using Pyhton Anywhere.
